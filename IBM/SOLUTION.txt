ðŸ›£ PMGSY Scheme Classification System â€“ Summary
This project presents a machine learningâ€“based solution to automatically classify rural infrastructure projects under the correct PMGSY scheme (PMGSY-I, II, III, RCPLWEA). It aims to streamline planning and monitoring for government departments.
Components
 Data Collection: Aggregates historical project data (state, district, sanctioned work, completion status, financials).
 Data Preprocessing: Cleans dataset by removing irrelevant columns and handling missing values (e.g., COST_OF_WORKS_SANCTIONED).
 Modeling: Implements a multi-class classification model using algorithms like Random Forest for robust and interpretable predictions.
 Deployment: Provides a web-based dashboard for real-time classification, hosted on platforms like IBM Cloud.
 Evaluation: Integrates watsonx.ai for model explainability and ensures continuous performance monitoring and retraining.
Outcome
The system enables accurate, automated classification of rural projects, improving transparency, reducing manual errors, and supporting smarter rural development planning.
